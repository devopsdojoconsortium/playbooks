# Agile Methodologies

The following is a comparison of common methodologies. It does not represent rules that must be followed, rather they are common practices for those methodologies. As in all agile development, practices evolve and should meet the context of the team and product. Most teams will find a combination of the two to be most effective.

|                     | Scrum                                         | Kanban                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cadence             | Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks)    | Continuous flow               |
| Release methodology | At least once per sprint                      | Continuous Delivery           |
| Roles               | Product owner, scrum master, development team | No required roles             |
| Key metrics         | Velocity                                      | Lead time, cycle time, WIP    |
| Change philosophy   | Teams should not plans during the sprint.     | Change can happen at any time |
