# Creating Playbooks

**Playbooks are focused documents** that can be used as a reference by teams wanting to improve how they perform an activity. Each playbook is focused on a single area.

## Recommended Practices

Each playbook should follow the following structure:

- Definition of what the playbook is trying to accomplish.
- Recommended Practices that have been found effective.
- Tips and tricks that have been found useful in the past.
- A user story for the activity that includes the expected value delivered by executing the playbook.
- Acceptance criteria for that story.

### Tips

Keep the playbook short enough that it can fit on a single handout. Slice if required.

## Value

As a playbook author I want to use a standard format for playbooks so that readers have a consistant experience.

### Acceptance criteria

- The playbook will print on a standard sheet of paper.
- The playbook contains actionable steps
- The playbook contains information for measuring successful implementation of the play.
